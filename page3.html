<br><br>Step 15
<br>Place a reheated iOpener over the bottom portion of the display assembly.
<br>Place a reheated iOpener over the bottom portion of the display assembly.
<br>There are delicate components in this portion of the phone, you want to ensure the adhesive is warm and easy to loosen to protect the phone.
<br><br>Step 16
<br>The bottom end of the phone contains the soft button and home button ribbon cables. If you insert the opening pick too far into the phone you risk cutting these cables.
<br>
<br>
<br>
<br>The bottom end of the phone contains the soft button and home button ribbon cables. If you insert the opening pick too far into the phone you risk cutting these cables.
<br>Slide the very end of the opening pick across the bottom edge of the display to separate the last of the remaining adhesive.
<br><br>Step 17
<br>Twist the opening pick to detach the glass from the phone.
<br>
<br>
<br>Twist the opening pick to detach the glass from the phone.
<br>If the front panel does not detach easily, it may require additional adhesive cutting.
<br><br>Step 18
<br>If the front panel is not easily freed, the adhesive on the soft button cable may need to be separated.
<br>
<br>
<br>If the front panel is not easily freed, the adhesive on the soft button cable may need to be separated.
<br>These cables are thin and easily damaged, therefore be certain you are only peeling them off the display assembly and not lacerating them.
<br>Insert an opening pick under the soft button icons on the display and pry the button cables down off the inside of the front panel.
<br><br>Step 19
<br>Slightly lift, but do not remove, the home button end of display assembly.
<br>
<br>
<br>Slightly lift, but do not remove, the home button end of display assembly.
<br>Do not remove the front panel entirely. It is still attached by a connector.
<br>If you are reusing the home button flex cable, be careful not to sever the cable from the home button. Adhesive can cause the cable to rip apart from the home button. While the home button will still work, the fingerprint scanner will not.
<br><br>Step 20
<br> Use the sharp tip of a spudger to lift the front panel assembly cable connector straight up off its socket on the motherboard.

                        <p>What you need
<br>
<br>•	small screwdriver
<br>•	pry tool
<br>•	spudger
<br>•	hair dryer
<br>•	new charging port/daughterboard
<br>
<br>STEP 1: Remove the rear case cover, battery, and micro SD card.
<br>
<br>STEP 2: Use the pry tool to remove the midframe connector panel; then use the spudger to remove the home button cable connector. 
<br>
<br>STEP 3: Use the hair dryer to heat the screen side of your Galaxy S5. Then, use your pry tool to gently pry around the edges as you heat. The heat will loosen the adhesive affixing the screen to the frame. Keep heating and prying until you can pull the screen away from the frame, hinged at the top. 
<br>
<br>STEP 4: Use the spudger to remove the front panel assembly cable; now you can remove the screen (front panel assembly) completely.
<br>
<br>STEP 5: Remove the ten midframe screws from the front panel assembly side of the midframe, then turn your Galaxy S5 over and remove two additional screws on the back of the midframe.
<br><br>STEP 6: Use the pry tool to carefully remove the back half of the midframe. 
<br>
<br>STEP 7: Use the spudger to disconnect the antenna connector. 
<br>
<br>STEP 8: Pull the top of the motherboard up from the midframe to expose the connectors underneath, but do not remove it. 
<br>
<br>STEP 9: Use the spudger to remove the daughterboard connector from the motherboard. 
<br>
<br>STEP 10: Use the spudger to remove the soft rubber cables from the midframe. 
<br>
<br>STEP 11: Remove the single charging port/daughterboard screw. 
<br>
<br>STEP 12: Use the spudger to pull the charging port/daughterboard away from the midframe. Be careful, because it's held down with adhesive. 
<br>
<br>STEP 13: Insert the new charging port/daughterboard, then reassemble your Samsung Galaxy S5 by following these directions in reverse order. .</p>

                        <p>1. The camera lens cover/ring can pry from that corner with much effort.
<br><br>2. Remove the camera lens cover, a lot adhesive can be seen here. The inner edges are glued black adhesive to seal the edges of camera lens, the outer edges are glued with crystal adhesive to seal the cover edges. That two kinds of adhesive sticker are the waterproof adhesive for S5.
<br><br>3. Now we can see the camera lens. And use the tweezers to insert into the edges of camera lens and cut the adhesive under the camera lens, and can remove the camera lens.
<br><br>4. Have a look at the removed camera lens. It's really weak. The lacquer along the edges have been scratched.
<br><br>5. Sorry i removed the black adhesive felt pad (i don't know how to name it), but you can still see a little there. Maybe you can imagine what is full of the black adhesive except the center.
<br><br>Samsung really do a lot for achieving water resistant which proved by replacing a broken camera lens. Fixing is really not easy, and a lot original adhesive are needed.
<br>
<br>At least for now, it's not wise to repair it yourself. So good luck to you!</p>

<br>Twist the opening pick to detach the glass from the phone. 
<br>If the front panel does not detach easily, it may require additional adhesive cutting. 
<br>
<br>Step 18 
<br>If the front panel is not easily freed, the adhesive on the soft button cable may need to be separated. 
<br>
<br>
<br>If the front panel is not easily freed, the adhesive on the soft button cable may need to be separated. 
<br>These cables are thin and easily damaged, therefore be certain you are only peeling them off the display assembly and not lacerating them. 
<br>Insert an opening pick under the soft button icons on the display and pry the button cables down off the inside of the front panel. 
<br>
<br>Step 19 
<br>Slightly lift, but do not remove, the home button end of display assembly. 
<br>
<br>
<br>Slightly lift, but do not remove, the home button end of display assembly. 
<br>Do not remove the front panel entirely. It is still attached by a connector. 
<br>If you are reusing the home button flex cable, be careful not to sever the cable from the home button. Adhesive can cause the cable to rip apart from the home button. While the home button will still work, the fingerprint scanner will not. 
<br>
<br>Step 20 
<br>Use the sharp tip of a spudger to lift the front panel assembly cable connector straight up off its socket on the motherboard.&nbsp;</p>
